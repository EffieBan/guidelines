**2. Weather in Goteborg**

____

___We arrived Goteborg at noon after which the driver picked us up and sent us directly to the apartment. Through the way of driving, the impression for us is that the place is vast and splendid with forests, grasslands and waters. The temperature here is around -1 degree with very little temperature difference during the day. It is similar to Dalian, a costal city in Northern part of China. Since we came from Northern part of China, we can adopt to the environment easily. The wind here is sometimes strong, with some rain or even snow. But, don't worry. It is not very cold.___
